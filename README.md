# RubiAI

RubiAI is a natural language processing model trained on the GPT-2 architecture. It can generate human-like text based on the input it receives.

## About

RubiAI is developed as part of PQAR (Plex Quantum and Atomic Research). It leverages the power of the GPT-2 model to generate text that mimics human-like responses and conversations.

## Features

- Generates text based on given prompts.
- Can be fine-tuned on specific datasets for specialized tasks.
- Easy-to-use interface for interacting with the model.
