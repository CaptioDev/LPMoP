Why do people buy early access games and then leave negative reviews about them being unfinished?
I'm really sad today, a few days ago I released a game on steam early access.

It is an early build but the gameplay loop is there and it is going to be build upon over time until we hit 1.0 and it is finished.

We've written on the store page about the game being unfinished, in an early state and being a base we will build upon over the next year.

This is also pointed out at the beginning of the game in-game to manage expectations.

However literally the first day I got a scathing review about the game being unfinished and complaining about various things that aren't even advertised.

I fixed most of the issues discovered on the same day.

Like I would understand if we've been in early access for years and still having the same issues but it is **literally the first few days.**

The game hasn't even had a chance to have a few decent updates yet based on feedback.

Why do people leave reviews like this so quickly, especially for newly released early access games. :(

It is the only review we have and it sucks that the first thing people will see is a scathing review, with half of it being about things we already fixed and a lot of it being about things that we can't really do anything about since it is expectation of things we never said were in the game.

Its really sad to see this after working so hard to get a decent playable build that justifies going into early access.

We've had great feedback from other players who are more understanding and we have direct communication with a lot of people who are actively helping us make the game better and what they would like to see. This is how early access is supposed to work.

Edit:

A lot of people are rolling in here, making a lot of assumptions, effectively calling me a shitty dev/accusing me of releasing a shitty game/releasing an unfinished product that I'm never going to fix or hit 1.0 with.

The whole point of early access is the product is unfinished.

"¬†Early Access is a place for games that are in a **playable alpha or beta state**, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release."

When was the last time an Alpha or Beta was a finished and perfectly polished project? In what world?

If I didn't think this statement was true for my game, I wouldn't have released it. This does not make me a shitty dev just because some shitty devs gamed the system and soured people.

I'm also not complaining about getting feedback, feedback is fine because it helps me make the game better.

Edit 2:

People are extremely salty about early access games being early access or unfinished. It is literally the point, that is what early access was created for. Your personal opinions or the fact some devs use it as a soft launch for a game that is 99% complete don't change that. Nobody is "forcing" you to buy them if you don't believe in the system.

Nobody is "forcing" you to be a beta tester either.

If a game is already perfect and finished then what is the point of it being early access? At that point just release it normally.  
This hive mind level of vitriol and lack of nuance is disturbing considering this is supposed to be a gamedev community.

Why should gamedevs not use the options given to them?

How do you read the annotations in "A Series of Unfortunate Events"?
My 10yo (advanced reader for his age) just started "A Series of Unfortunate Events". He loves it, but he did not read the annotations at the end of the first book, and even I can't really figure out how to most enjoy them.

I am not sure if this an issue of our version, but for us, they are printed at the end of the book with side number references. They are certainly funny in their absurdity, but I am not sure if they are really funny enough to go back through the book, follow references in annotations etc ... especially for a 10yo.

You also cannot really read them while reading the book, because they sometimes reference other FUTURE annotations, and you would have to regularly check if you missed one, because they are not indicated on the main pages.

Are they an essential part of the experience? I am thinking of Pratchett footnotes here, which really carry a lot of the humor. Countless of them are absolute gold, but even there I am not sure if I would go back through the book and read them at the end.

What is the gamedev equivalent of "pixel-fucking"?
Pixel fucking is term coined in the VFX industry where a director or supervisor focus too much attention on the very tiny details the audience will barely even see than the overall effectiveness of the shot.
I was wondering if there is a gamedev equivalent to this term.

My experience being pixel-fucked was with an art lead who is obsessed with centimeter-accurate bevels throughout the entire mesh that will eventually be baked down to a lowpoly anyway ü§£. Imo that's just something players will never notice and never care about.

Lightning hasn‚Äôt fixed BTC
Lightning hasn‚Äôt fixed BTC

I think some people have already accepted that BTC is a store of value and is as unsuitable for real world use as a brick of gold.

But I still regularly hear people say ‚Äúlightning fixes this‚Äù or similar. If I scrolled far enough through my history I‚Äôd probably find that in my own comments.

But, It doesn‚Äôt.

I tried to receive a lighting payment and found out BlueWallet‚Äôs lightning node was shutdown last year.

Muun, one of the most well known wallets says I can‚Äôt receive lightning payments [because of network congestion](https://postimg.cc/hzzypJML). (Wasn‚Äôt that exactly what lightning was supposed to fix?)

The future is in L1s with high capacity. That isn‚Äôt debatable.
Reddit, what's a sad reality that most people refuse to accept ?

Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit‚Äôs headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools‚Äô Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We‚Äôve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven‚Äôt been completely happy about every change that we‚Äôve witnessed, we‚Äôve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit‚Äôs API; changes which ‚Äì despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors ‚Äì threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit‚Äôs statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit‚Äôs User Agreement and Reddit‚Äôs Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators‚Äô behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of "Moderator Advocate" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood ‚Äì its multitude of moderators and contributors ‚Äì consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform‚Äôs many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit‚Äôs administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded‚Ä¶ but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Looking for examples of good and also bad examples of video games localization

Hi everybody, hope you are doing great. I'm looking for a help. So I'm currently finishing my studies and writing my bachelor's thesis where I research game localization.  I'm finishing writing theories and slowly want to start researching.  I hoped that maybe there would be people here who knew examples that I could use in my research.

One of the examples that I liked was discovered while playing Wolfenstein the Old Blood where Blazkovich introduces himself as Claus and later adds Santa, where the Polish version uses Hans Kloss, who is a very popular character from the old Polish film and the names in the pronunciation sound the same

maybe you know something similar or really any, you will help me a lot.  I also want to take a closer look at the Witcher and Assassin's Creed series.  anyway, if you have any ideas or examples, it will help me a lot by sharing them.
A bit of a lot of text, but I wanted to outline the situation.  Regards! üòÄ

Just read ‚ÄòThe Second Sex‚Äô. 
For all the great work Simone de Beauvoir did, Its sort of upsetting to realize her crimes are what she will be remembered for. 

I thought the entire chapter ‚Äòchildhood‚Äô is such a well written case. I‚Äôm a male myself, and I think to see a case that I have no perspective on, so wonderfully projected. I think it was bold, and explains the outrage that took place at the time regarding this work. Her explaining similarities with how a woman is not born but rather developed into one. Its a fascinating explanation. I wonder what everyone else thinks of this book.

How do you read the annotations in "A Series of Unfortunate Events"?
My 10yo (advanced reader for his age) just started "A Series of Unfortunate Events". He loves it, but he did not read the annotations at the end of the first book, and even I can't really figure out how to most enjoy them.

I am not sure if this an issue of our version, but for us, they are printed at the end of the book with side number references. They are certainly funny in their absurdity, but I am not sure if they are really funny enough to go back through the book, follow references in annotations etc ... especially for a 10yo.

You also cannot really read them while reading the book, because they sometimes reference other FUTURE annotations, and you would have to regularly check if you missed one, because they are not indicated on the main pages.

Are they an essential part of the experience? I am thinking of Pratchett footnotes here, which really carry a lot of the humor. Countless of them are absolute gold, but even there I am not sure if I would go back through the book and read them at the end.
Programers will understand...

Where/How to hire 3D Artists for Indie Dev?
I've done small projects on my free time as a hobby, and I'm not bad at all with UE. I've also worked freelance jobs for small time mobile developers, but I can't do 3D at all. I've tried to learn Blender several times and still can't do shit. Without an interesting art style and consistently good quality assets, idk if I can make an actual full game at any point. I have a full-time AI/ML Engineer job so my salary isn't too bad, so if I wanted to hire a 3D artist for something similar to Ultrakill's art style for instance, how would I go about finding an artist? Where should I look? How much does it usually cost? Or is there anything else I need to be considering on top of this in terms of expenses? The style I'd prefer is either closer to Ultrakill, or more closer to System Shock Remake depending on how much it'd cost. I'm mostly a hobbyist messing around in UE, and this is kind of a hypothetical question in case I want to make a passion project that I actually try and publish. Sorry if this is a dumb question, I don't know much about game dev on a commercial level.

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit
To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit‚Äôs most-popular communities. That time hasn‚Äôt been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we‚Äôve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit‚Äôs headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools‚Äô Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We‚Äôve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven‚Äôt been completely happy about every change that we‚Äôve witnessed, we‚Äôve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit‚Äôs API; changes which ‚Äì despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors ‚Äì threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit‚Äôs statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit‚Äôs User Agreement and Reddit‚Äôs Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators‚Äô behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of "Moderator Advocate" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood ‚Äì its multitude of moderators and contributors ‚Äì consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform‚Äôs many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit‚Äôs administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded‚Ä¶ but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

My first ever nintendo console was my gameboy sp. I loved it when I was younger and played Kirby and the Amazing Mirror on it all the time. When I went to my grandmas to get it, everything was in a room as I and she left it. She helped me find it and gave me the charger cord. However, when I went to take it home. I couldnt help but feel sad about it. Like I had taken something that I shouldnt have taken. I walked out of the door feeling like I disturbed something that I enjoyed years and years ago.

My experience with Reddit ads
I have been marketing my game with the free way for almost 3 years and it was so hard to get the right players who really interested in the game you making.  
So because I am really close to  to release my game I wanted to try something with low budget (30$)  
I picked the big games subreddits and I focused on clicks to visit my steam page, launch my ad.  
This is the results on the reddit ad manager:   
impressions: 77,392 |Clicks : 210 | Money spent: 30$  
The reddit ads  results was really good but the problem is I don't know how they count clicks in this website.   
When I checked on the steam stats after they updated I found out that I got only 14 clicks from reddit lol, so reddit ads using bots ? or just lying ?   


Any one had the same experience?

What games if any. Made you just say fuck it, I can‚Äôt beat this level and quit?
For me it was CONTROL. When you go against this flying demon pretty early on, you can get killed in maybe 1 to 2 hits. Shooting the thing is beyond frustrating, even if I dialed down the level. 

Curious what everyone‚Äôs else‚Äôs was.  I mean I love a challenge but sometimes they suck all the fun out of it. 
Could you be at risk?

Yes, my cat hates my dog. I'm pretty sure she thought about murder here.
Which obstacle / what surprise in the developing process has driven you to radically change your project, or even abandon it?
For me, it was the sobering realisation after the concept phase that I won't get the right 3D-models for my vision, nor can I offer time and energy to learn creating high-poly assets myself. So I switched to stylized assets and sacrificed realism for an more arcade-like experience.  
What's your story?

I can‚Äôt seem to get into ‚ÄúRemains of the day‚Äù by kazuo ishiguro
I read ‚Äúnever let me go‚Äù by kazuo Ishiguro just recently, I loved the book so much. Went ahead to watch interviews by the author about the book and the movie adaptation. Came here on Reddit and I saw good recommendations concerning ‚Äúremains of the day‚Äù. I just can‚Äôt get into the book. Usually I‚Äôm a fast reader but whenever. Find myself reading the book I zone out completely because I find myself getting bored. 
I just want to know if it gets better? 

TLDR - does it get better with ‚Äúremains of the day‚Äù, do I continue? Getting bored with the book.

Just read ‚ÄòThe Second Sex‚Äô. 
For all the great work Simone de Beauvoir did, Its sort of upsetting to realize her crimes are what she will be remembered for. 

I thought the entire chapter ‚Äòchildhood‚Äô is such a well written case. I‚Äôm a male myself, and I think to see a case that I have no perspective on, so wonderfully projected. I think it was bold, and explains the outrage that took place at the time regarding this work. Her explaining similarities with how a woman is not born but rather developed into one. Its a fascinating explanation. I wonder what everyone else thinks of this book. 
Why is Europe losing the productivity race?

How do you read the annotations in "A Series of Unfortunate Events"?
My 10yo (advanced reader for his age) just started "A Series of Unfortunate Events". He loves it, but he did not read the annotations at the end of the first book, and even I can't really figure out how to most enjoy them.

I am not sure if this an issue of our version, but for us, they are printed at the end of the book with side number references. They are certainly funny in their absurdity, but I am not sure if they are really funny enough to go back through the book, follow references in annotations etc ... especially for a 10yo.

You also cannot really read them while reading the book, because they sometimes reference other FUTURE annotations, and you would have to regularly check if you missed one, because they are not indicated on the main pages.

Are they an essential part of the experience? I am thinking of Pratchett footnotes here, which really carry a lot of the humor. Countless of them are absolute gold, but even there I am not sure if I would go back through the book and read them at the end.

Weekly Recommendation Thread: April 19, 2024
Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many "suggest some books" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

**The Rules**

* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

____

**How to get the best recommendations**

The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.

Looking for examples of good and also bad examples of video games localization

Hi everybody, hope you are doing great. I'm looking for a help. So I'm currently finishing my studies and writing my bachelor's thesis where I research game localization.  I'm finishing writing theories and slowly want to start researching.  I hoped that maybe there would be people here who knew examples that I could use in my research.

One of the examples that I liked was discovered while playing Wolfenstein the Old Blood where Blazkovich introduces himself as Claus and later adds Santa, where the Polish version uses Hans Kloss, who is a very popular character from the old Polish film and the names in the pronunciation sound the same

maybe you know something similar or really any, you will help me a lot.  I also want to take a closer look at the Witcher and Assassin's Creed series.  anyway, if you have any ideas or examples, it will help me a lot by sharing them.
A bit of a lot of text, but I wanted to outline the situation.  Regards! üòÄ

Why do people buy early access games and then leave negative reviews about them being unfinished?
I'm really sad today, a few days ago I released a game on steam early access.

It is an early build but the gameplay loop is there and it is going to be build upon over time until we hit 1.0 and it is finished.

We've written on the store page about the game being unfinished, in an early state and being a base we will build upon over the next year.

This is also pointed out at the beginning of the game in-game to manage expectations.

However literally the first day I got a scathing review about the game being unfinished and complaining about various things that aren't even advertised.

I fixed most of the issues discovered on the same day.

Like I would understand if we've been in early access for years and still having the same issues but it is **literally the first few days.**

The game hasn't even had a chance to have a few decent updates yet based on feedback.

Why do people leave reviews like this so quickly, especially for newly released early access games. :(

It is the only review we have and it sucks that the first thing people will see is a scathing review, with half of it being about things we already fixed and a lot of it being about things that we can't really do anything about since it is expectation of things we never said were in the game.

Its really sad to see this after working so hard to get a decent playable build that justifies going into early access.

We've had great feedback from other players who are more understanding and we have direct communication with a lot of people who are actively helping us make the game better and what they would like to see. This is how early access is supposed to work.

Edit:

A lot of people are rolling in here, making a lot of assumptions, effectively calling me a shitty dev/accusing me of releasing a shitty game/releasing an unfinished product that I'm never going to fix or hit 1.0 with.

The whole point of early access is the product is unfinished.

"¬†Early Access is a place for games that are in a **playable alpha or beta state**, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release."

When was the last time an Alpha or Beta was a finished and perfectly polished project? In what world?

If I didn't think this statement was true for my game, I wouldn't have released it. This does not make me a shitty dev just because some shitty devs gamed the system and soured people.

I'm also not complaining about getting feedback, feedback is fine because it helps me make the game better.

Edit 2:

People are extremely salty about early access games being early access or unfinished. It is literally the point, that is what early access was created for. Your personal opinions or the fact some devs use it as a soft launch for a game that is 99% complete don't change that. Nobody is "forcing" you to buy them if you don't believe in the system.

Nobody is "forcing" you to be a beta tester either.

If a game is already perfect and finished then what is the point of it being early access? At that point just release it normally.  
This hive mind level of vitriol and lack of nuance is disturbing considering this is supposed to be a gamedev community.

Why should gamedevs not use the options given to them?

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit
To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit‚Äôs most-popular communities. That time hasn‚Äôt been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we‚Äôve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit‚Äôs headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools‚Äô Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We‚Äôve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven‚Äôt been completely happy about every change that we‚Äôve witnessed, we‚Äôve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit‚Äôs API; changes which ‚Äì despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors ‚Äì threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit‚Äôs statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit‚Äôs User Agreement and Reddit‚Äôs Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators‚Äô behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of "Moderator Advocate" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood ‚Äì its multitude of moderators and contributors ‚Äì consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform‚Äôs many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit‚Äôs administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded‚Ä¶ but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

I recently picked up my old gameboy from my grandmas house and I feel so sad about it.
My first ever nintendo console was my gameboy sp. I loved it when I was younger and played Kirby and the Amazing Mirror on it all the time. When I went to my grandmas to get it, everything was in a room as I and she left it. She helped me find it and gave me the charger cord. However, when I went to take it home. I couldnt help but feel sad about it. Like I had taken something that I shouldnt have taken. I walked out of the door feeling like I disturbed something that I enjoyed years and years ago. Has anyone else experienced the same thing?

Why do people buy early access games and then leave negative reviews about them being unfinished?
I'm really sad today, a few days ago I released a game on steam early access.

It is an early build but the gameplay loop is there and it is going to be build upon over time until we hit 1.0 and it is finished.

We've written on the store page about the game being unfinished, in an early state and being a base we will build upon over the next year.

This is also pointed out at the beginning of the game in-game to manage expectations.

However literally the first day I got a scathing review about the game being unfinished and complaining about various things that aren't even advertised.

I fixed most of the issues discovered on the same day.

Like I would understand if we've been in early access for years and still having the same issues but it is **literally the first few days.**

The game hasn't even had a chance to have a few decent updates yet based on feedback.

Why do people leave reviews like this so quickly, especially for newly released early access games. :(

It is the only review we have and it sucks that the first thing people will see is a scathing review, with half of it being about things we already fixed and a lot of it being about things that we can't really do anything about since it is expectation of things we never said were in the game.

Its really sad to see this after working so hard to get a decent playable build that justifies going into early access.

We've had great feedback from other players who are more understanding and we have direct communication with a lot of people who are actively helping us make the game better and what they would like to see. This is how early access is supposed to work.

Edit:

A lot of people are rolling in here, making a lot of assumptions, effectively calling me a shitty dev/accusing me of releasing a shitty game/releasing an unfinished product that I'm never going to fix or hit 1.0 with.

The whole point of early access is the product is unfinished.

"¬†Early Access is a place for games that are in a **playable alpha or beta state**, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release."

When was the last time an Alpha or Beta was a finished and perfectly polished project? In what world?

If I didn't think this statement was true for my game, I wouldn't have released it. This does not make me a shitty dev just because some shitty devs gamed the system and soured people.

I'm also not complaining about getting feedback, feedback is fine because it helps me make the game better.

Edit 2:

People are extremely salty about early access games being early access or unfinished. It is literally the point, that is what early access was created for. Your personal opinions or the fact some devs use it as a soft launch for a game that is 99% complete don't change that. Nobody is "forcing" you to buy them if you don't believe in the system.

Nobody is "forcing" you to be a beta tester either.

If a game is already perfect and finished then what is the point of it being early access? At that point just release it normally.  
This hive mind level of vitriol and lack of nuance is disturbing considering this is supposed to be a gamedev community.

Why should gamedevs not use the options given to them?

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit
To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit‚Äôs most-popular communities. That time hasn‚Äôt been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we‚Äôve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit‚Äôs headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools‚Äô Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We‚Äôve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven‚Äôt been completely happy about every change that we‚Äôve witnessed, we‚Äôve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit‚Äôs API; changes which ‚Äì despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors ‚Äì threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit‚Äôs statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit‚Äôs User Agreement and Reddit‚Äôs Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators‚Äô behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of "Moderator Advocate" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood ‚Äì its multitude of moderators and contributors ‚Äì consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform‚Äôs many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit‚Äôs administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded‚Ä¶ but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Why do people buy early access games and then leave negative reviews about them being unfinished?
I'm really sad today, a few days ago I released a game on steam early access.

It is an early build but the gameplay loop is there and it is going to be build upon over time until we hit 1.0 and it is finished.

We've written on the store page about the game being unfinished, in an early state and being a base we will build upon over the next year.

This is also pointed out at the beginning of the game in-game to manage expectations.

However literally the first day I got a scathing review about the game being unfinished and complaining about various things that aren't even advertised.

I fixed most of the issues discovered on the same day.

How do you prototype games fast if you're bad at art?
Imagine if even the most basic 2D art was painfully slow and hard for you. To the point where you tried to approach it over many years, but every time you failed miserably. That's me. 

For an actual polished commercial release, I will hire a professional artist. But how would you approach the initial stages of rapid prototyping and iteration if you sucked at art as bad as I do?

- Prototype gameplay loops with boxes and spheres? 

- Grab free asset packs and prototype with that? I've tried using asset packs. They heavily distort how your prototype feels.

- Suck it up and focus on learning 2D/3D art to at least some degree? I've tried many many many times, and it's just not my cup of tea. 

Would be great to hear any tips about art in prototyping workflows from your experience.

Weekly Recommendation Thread: April 19, 2024
Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many "suggest some books" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.

Which obstacle / what surprise in the developing process has driven you to radically change your project, or even abandon it?
For me, it was the sobering realisation after the concept phase that I won't get the right 3D-models for my vision, nor can I offer time and energy to learn creating high-poly assets myself. So I switched to stylized assets and sacrificed realism for an more arcade-like experience.

Looking for examples of good and also bad examples of video games localization

Hi everybody, hope you are doing great. I'm looking for a help. So I'm currently finishing my studies and writing my bachelor's thesis where I research game localization.  I'm finishing writing theories and slowly want to start researching.  I hoped that maybe there would be people here who knew examples that I could use in my research.

One of the examples that I liked was discovered while playing Wolfenstein the Old Blood where Blazkovich introduces himself as Claus and later adds Santa, where the Polish version uses Hans Kloss, who is a very popular character from the old Polish film and the names in the pronunciation sound the same

maybe you know something similar or really any, you will help me a lot.  I also want to take a closer look at the Witcher and Assassin's Creed series.  anyway, if you have any ideas or examples, it will help me a lot by sharing them.

Why do people buy early access games and then leave negative reviews about them being unfinished?
I'm really sad today, a few days ago I released a game on steam early access.

It is an early build but the gameplay loop is there and it is going to be build upon over time until we hit 1.0 and it is finished.

We've written on the store page about the game being unfinished, in an early state and being a base we will build upon over the next year.

This is also pointed out at the beginning of the game in-game to manage expectations.

However literally the first day I got a scathing review about the game being unfinished and complaining about various things that aren't even advertised.

I fixed most of the issues discovered on the same day.

Like I would understand if we've been in early access for years and still having the same issues but it is **literally the first few days.**

The game hasn't even had a chance to have a few decent updates yet based on feedback.

Why do people leave reviews like this so quickly, especially for newly released early access games. :(

It is the only review we have and it sucks that the first thing people will see is a scathing review, with half of it being about things we already fixed and a lot of it being about things that we can't really do anything about since it is expectation of things we never said were in the game.

Its really sad to see this after working so hard to get a decent playable build that justifies going into early access.

We've had great feedback from other players who are more understanding and we have direct communication with a lot of people who are actively helping us make the game better and what they would like to see. This is how early access is supposed to work.

Edit:

A lot of people are rolling in here, making a lot of assumptions, effectively calling me a shitty dev/accusing me of releasing a shitty game/releasing an unfinished product that I'm never going to fix or hit 1.0 with.

The whole point of early access is the product is unfinished.

"¬†Early Access is a place for games that are in a **playable alpha or beta state**, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release."

When was the last time an Alpha or Beta was a finished and perfectly polished project? In what world?

If I didn't think this statement was true for my game, I wouldn't have released it. This does not make me a shitty dev just because some shitty devs gamed the system and soured people.

I'm also not complaining about getting feedback, feedback is fine because it helps me make the game better.

Edit 2:

People are extremely salty about early access games being early access or unfinished. It is literally the point, that is what early access was created for. Your personal opinions or the fact some devs use it as a soft launch for a game that is 99% complete don't change that. Nobody is "forcing" you to buy them if you don't believe in the system.

Nobody is "forcing" you to be a beta tester either.

If a game is already perfect and finished then what is the point of it being early access? At that point just release it normally.  
This hive mind level of vitriol and lack of nuance is disturbing considering this is supposed to be a gamedev community.

Why should gamedevs not use the options given to them?

Looking for examples of good and also bad examples of video games localization

Hi everybody, hope you are doing great. I'm looking for a help. So I'm currently finishing my studies and writing my bachelor's thesis where I research game localization.  I'm finishing writing theories and slowly want to start researching.  I hoped that maybe there would be people here who knew examples that I could use in my research.

One of the examples that I liked was discovered while playing Wolfenstein the Old Blood where Blazkovich introduces himself as Claus and later adds Santa, where the Polish version uses Hans Kloss, who is a very popular character from the old Polish film and the names in the pronunciation sound the same

maybe you know something similar or really any, you will help me a lot.  I also want to take a closer look at the Witcher and Assassin's Creed series.  anyway, if you have any ideas or examples, it will help me a lot by sharing them.
A bit of a lot of text, but I wanted to outline the situation.  Regards! üòÄ

For me it was CONTROL. When you go against this flying demon pretty early on, you can get killed in maybe 1 to 2 hits. Shooting the thing is beyond frustrating, even if I dialed down the level. 

Curious what everyone‚Äôs else‚Äôs was.  I mean I love a challenge but sometimes they suck all the fun out of it.

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit‚Äôs most-popular communities. That time hasn‚Äôt been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we‚Äôve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit‚Äôs headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools‚Äô Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We‚Äôve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven‚Äôt been completely happy about every change that we‚Äôve witnessed, we‚Äôve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit‚Äôs API; changes which ‚Äì despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors ‚Äì threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit‚Äôs statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit‚Äôs User Agreement and Reddit‚Äôs Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators‚Äô behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of "Moderator Advocate" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood ‚Äì its multitude of moderators and contributors ‚Äì consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform‚Äôs many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit‚Äôs administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded‚Ä¶ but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Weekly Recommendation Thread: April 19, 2024
Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many "suggest some books" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

**The Rules**

* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

____

**How to get the best recommendations**

The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

____

All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.

If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

How do you read the annotations in "A Series of Unfortunate Events"?
My 10yo (advanced reader for his age) just started "A Series of Unfortunate Events". He loves it, but he did not read the annotations at the end of the first book, and even I can't really figure out how to most enjoy them.

I am not sure if this an issue of our version, but for us, they are printed at the end of the book with side number references. They are certainly funny in their absurdity, but I am not sure if they are really funny enough to go back through the book, follow references in annotations etc ... especially for a 10yo.

You also cannot really read them while reading the book, because they sometimes reference other FUTURE annotations, and you would have to regularly check if you missed one, because they are not indicated on the main pages.

Are they an essential part of the experience? I am thinking of Pratchett footnotes here, which really carry a lot of the humor. Countless of them are absolute gold, but even there I am not sure if I would go back through the book and read them at the end.

Is it better to get a cheaper/weaker GPU for development?

What is the gamedev equivalent of "pixel-fucking"?
Pixel fucking is term coined in the VFX industry where a director or supervisor focus too much attention on the very tiny details the audience will barely even see than the overall effectiveness of the shot.
I was wondering if there is a gamedev equivalent to this term.

My experience being pixel-fucked was with an art lead who is obsessed with centimeter-accurate bevels throughout the entire mesh that will eventually be baked down to a lowpoly anyway ü§£. Imo that's just something players will never notice and never care about.
What's your experience?

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit
To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit‚Äôs most-popular communities. That time hasn‚Äôt been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we‚Äôve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit‚Äôs headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools‚Äô Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We‚Äôve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven‚Äôt been completely happy about every change that we‚Äôve witnessed, we‚Äôve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit‚Äôs API; changes which ‚Äì despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors ‚Äì threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit‚Äôs statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit‚Äôs User Agreement and Reddit‚Äôs Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators‚Äô behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of "Moderator Advocate" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood ‚Äì its multitude of moderators and contributors ‚Äì consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform‚Äôs many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit‚Äôs administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded‚Ä¶ but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

I recently picked up my old gameboy from my grandmas house and I feel so sad about it.
My first ever nintendo console was my gameboy sp. I loved it when I was younger and played Kirby and the Amazing Mirror on it all the time. When I went to my grandmas to get it, everything was in a room as I and she left it. She helped me find it and gave me the charger cord. However, when I went to take it home. I couldnt help but feel sad about it. Like I had taken something that I shouldnt have taken. I walked out of the door feeling like I disturbed something that I enjoyed years and years ago. Has anyone else experienced the same thing?

How do you prototype games fast if you're bad at art?
Imagine if even the most basic 2D art was painfully slow and hard for you. To the point where you tried to approach it over many years, but every time you failed miserably. That's me. 

For an actual polished commercial release, I will hire a professional artist. But how would you approach the initial stages of rapid prototyping and iteration if you sucked at art as bad as I do?

- Prototype gameplay loops with boxes and spheres? 

- Grab free asset packs and prototype with that? I've tried using asset packs. They heavily distort how your prototype feels.

- Suck it up and focus on learning 2D/3D art to at least some degree? I've tried many many many times, and it's just not my cup of tea. 

Would be great to hear any tips about art in prototyping workflows from your experience.

My experience with Reddit ads
I have been marketing my game with the free way for almost 3 years and it was so hard to get the right players who really interested in the game you making.  
So because I am really close to  to release my game I wanted to try something with low budget (30$)  
I picked the big games subreddits and I focused on clicks to visit my steam page, launch my ad.  
This is the results on the reddit ad manager:   
impressions: 77,392 |Clicks : 210 | Money spent: 30$  
The reddit ads  results was really good but the problem is I don't know how they count clicks in this website.   
When I checked on the steam stats after they updated I found out that I got only 14 clicks from reddit lol, so reddit ads using bots ? or just lying ?   


Any one had the same experience?

Just read ‚ÄòThe Second Sex‚Äô. 
For all the great work Simone de Beauvoir did, Its sort of upsetting to realize her crimes are what she will be remembered for. 

I thought the entire chapter ‚Äòchildhood‚Äô is such a well written case. I‚Äôm a male myself, and I think to see a case that I have no perspective on, so wonderfully projected. I think it was bold, and explains the outrage that took place at the time regarding this work. Her explaining similarities with how a woman is not born but rather developed into one. Its a fascinating explanation. I wonder what everyone else thinks of this book.

How do you read the annotations in "A Series of Unfortunate Events"?
My 10yo (advanced reader for his age) just started "A Series of Unfortunate Events". He loves it, but he did not read the annotations at the end of the first book, and even I can't really figure out how to most enjoy them.

I am not sure if this an issue of our version, but for us, they are printed at the end of the book with side number references. They are certainly funny in their absurdity, but I am not sure if they are really funny enough to go back through the book, follow references in annotations etc ... especially for a 10yo.

You also cannot really read them while reading the book, because they sometimes reference other FUTURE annotations, and you would have to regularly check if you missed one, because they are not indicated on the main pages.

Are they an essential part of the experience? I am thinking of Pratchett footnotes here, which really carry a lot of the humor. Countless of them are absolute gold, but even there I am not sure if I would go back through the book and read them at the end.

How to make my game responsive 
So i‚Äôm making a 2D multiplayer turn based strategy game with phaser. In the game theres a static board(like in Chess games) that is a hexagon grid. I want to make this board responsive so that it fits on mobile and pc(its vertical so it would fit mobile well). The problem is i dont know how i should do this. My first idea was to make the game window a set size(that i could change for mobile etc) and then fit the board within it(this was really hard for some reason and i couldnt manage to do this). But a problem with this is that i want to make board in different shapes later, and it doesnt make sense to keep changing the game window. The second idea was to make the game Windows size be based on the board, but then i would have to give the board a set size. If i chose this second method, should i change the size of the sprites? Or should i just fit the sprites/tiles within a set aspect ratio etc. 
The idea for the game is that its kind of a mix between Chess and civ. Where the combat is more similar to civ. But the board sizes and game speed etc is more similar to Chess.
Also how can i size the board so that units will be sized and positioned correctly whithin the board? The board will be 15x9 tiles big ca, and should fit mobile screen width 100%. But not on pc etc.

How can i make this? I have no idea how i could do this the best way. Should i give the board a set size? I have to resize the hexagon sprites i use anyway, but What method should i use to do this?

Why do people buy early access games and then leave negative reviews about them being unfinished?
I'm really sad today, a few days ago I released a game on steam early access.

It is an early build but the gameplay loop is there and it is going to be build upon over time until we hit 1.0 and it is finished.

We've written on the store page about the game being unfinished, in an early state and being a base we will build upon over the next year.

This is also pointed out at the beginning of the game in-game to manage expectations.

However literally the first day I got a scathing review about the game being unfinished and complaining about various things that aren't even advertised.

I fixed most of the issues discovered on the same day.

Like I would understand if we've been in early access for years and still having the same issues but it is **literally the first few days.**

The game hasn't even had a chance to have a few decent updates yet based on feedback.

Why do people leave reviews like this so quickly, especially for newly released early access games. :(

It is the only review we have and it sucks that the first thing people will see is a scathing review, with half of it being about things we already fixed and a lot of it being about things that we can't really do anything about since it is expectation of things we never said were in the game.

Its really sad to see this after working so hard to get a decent playable build that justifies going into early access.

We've had great feedback from other players who are more understanding and we have direct communication with a lot of people who are actively helping us make the game better and what they would like to see. This is how early access is supposed to work.

Edit:

A lot of people are rolling in here, making a lot of assumptions, effectively calling me a shitty dev/accusing me of releasing a shitty game/releasing an unfinished product that I'm never going to fix or hit 1.0 with.

The whole point of early access is the product is unfinished.

"¬†Early Access is a place for games that are in a **playable alpha or beta state**, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release."

When was the last time an Alpha or Beta was a finished and perfectly polished project? In what world?

If I didn't think this statement was true for my game, I wouldn't have released it. This does not make me a shitty dev just because some shitty devs gamed the system and soured people.

I'm also not complaining about getting feedback, feedback is fine because it helps me make the game better.

Edit 2:

People are extremely salty about early access games being early access or unfinished. It is literally the point, that is what early access was created for. Your personal opinions or the fact some devs use it as a soft launch for a game that is 99% complete don't change that. Nobody is "forcing" you to buy them if you don't believe in the system.

Nobody is "forcing" you to be a beta tester either.

If a game is already perfect and finished then what is the point of it being early access? At that point just release it normally.  
This hive mind level of vitriol and lack of nuance is disturbing considering this is supposed to be a gamedev community.

Why should gamedevs not use the options given to them?

Bitcoin Sold $8K Last Halving, Soared 721% After: Will History Repeat?
‚û°Ô∏è Michael Saylor called attention to the $8K price Bitcoin sold during 2020 halving.

‚û°Ô∏è In this year‚Äôs halving event, Bitcoin registered an intraday low of $59,651.

‚û°Ô∏è If Bitcoin replicates the 721% post-2020 rally in this cycle, it could reach $489K by next year.

My experience with Reddit ads
I have been marketing my game with the free way for almost 3 years and it was so hard to get the right players who really interested in the game you making.  
So because I am really close to  to release my game I wanted to try something with low budget (30$)  
I picked the big games subreddits and I focused on clicks to visit my steam page, launch my ad.  
This is the results on the reddit ad manager:   
impressions: 77,392 |Clicks : 210 | Money spent: 30$  
The reddit ads  results was really good but the problem is I don't know how they count clicks in this website.   
When I checked on the steam stats after they updated I found out that I got only 14 clicks from reddit lol, so reddit ads using bots ? or just lying ?   


Any one had the same experience?

UPDATE: My friend made new art for my failed game do you think it will help?
I showed my friend the feedback I got on my last post here. Everyone said I needed to work on the art and especially the cow. My friend offered to make art to replace some of mine and they came up with this:

Do you think I could make it work in the game?

How to make my game responsive 
So i‚Äôm making a 2D multiplayer turn based strategy game with phaser. In the game theres a static board(like in Chess games) that is a hexagon grid. I want to make this board responsive so that it fits on mobile and pc(its vertical so it would fit mobile well). The problem is i dont know how i should do this. My first idea was to make the game window a set size(that i could change for mobile etc) and then fit the board within it(this was really hard for some reason and i couldnt manage to do this). But a problem with this is that i want to make board in different shapes later, and it doesnt make sense to keep changing the game window. The second idea was to make the game Windows size be based on the board, but then i would have to give the board a set size. If i chose this second method, should i change the size of the sprites? Or should i just fit the sprites/tiles within a set aspect ratio etc. 
The idea for the game is that its kind of a mix between Chess and civ. Where the combat is more similar to civ. But the board sizes and game speed etc is more similar to Chess.
Also how can i size the board so that units will be sized and positioned correctly whithin the board? The board will be 15x9 tiles big ca, and should fit mobile screen width 100%. But not on pc etc.

How can i make this? I have no idea how i could do this the best way. Should i give the board a set size? I have to resize the hexagon sprites i use anyway, but What method should i use to do this?

How do you read the annotations in "A Series of Unfortunate Events"?
My 10yo (advanced reader for his age) just started "A Series of Unfortunate Events". He loves it, but he did not read the annotations at the end of the first book, and even I can't really figure out how to most enjoy them.

I am not sure if this an issue of our version, but for us, they are printed at the end of the book with side number references. They are certainly funny in their absurdity, but I am not sure if they are really funny enough to go back through the book, follow references in annotations etc ... especially for a 10yo.

You also cannot really read them while reading the book, because they sometimes reference other FUTURE annotations, and you would have to regularly check if you missed one, because they are not indicated on the main pages.

Are they an essential part of the experience? I am thinking of Pratchett footnotes here, which really carry a lot of the humor. Countless of them are absolute gold, but even there I am not sure if I would go back through the book and read them at the end.

I can‚Äôt seem to get into ‚ÄúRemains of the day‚Äù by kazuo ishiguro
I read ‚Äúnever let me go‚Äù by kazuo Ishiguro just recently, I loved the book so much. Went ahead to watch interviews by the author about the book and the movie adaptation. Came here on Reddit and I saw good recommendations concerning ‚Äúremains of the day‚Äù. I just can‚Äôt get into the book. Usually I‚Äôm a fast reader but whenever. Find myself reading the book I zone out completely because I find myself getting bored. 
I just want to know if it gets better? 

TLDR - does it get better with ‚Äúremains of the day‚Äù, do I continue? Getting bored with the book.

How do you prototype games fast if you're bad at art?
Imagine if even the most basic 2D art was painfully slow and hard for you. To the point where you tried to approach it over many years, but every time you failed miserably. That's me. 

For an actual polished commercial release, I will hire a professional artist. But how would you approach the initial stages of rapid prototyping and iteration if you sucked at art as bad as I do?

- Prototype gameplay loops with boxes and spheres? 

- Grab free asset packs and prototype with that? I've tried using asset packs. They heavily distort how your prototype feels.

- Suck it up and focus on learning 2D/3D art to at least some degree? I've tried many many many times, and it's just not my cup of tea. 

Would be great to hear any tips about art in prototyping workflows from your experience.

Lightning hasn‚Äôt fixed BTC

I think some people have already accepted that BTC is a store of value and is as unsuitable for real world use as a brick of gold.

But I still regularly hear people say ‚Äúlightning fixes this‚Äù or similar. If I scrolled far enough through my history I‚Äôd probably find that in my own comments.

But, It doesn‚Äôt.

I tried to receive a lighting payment and found out BlueWallet‚Äôs lightning node was shutdown last year.

I recently picked up my old gameboy from my grandmas house and I feel so sad about it.
My first ever nintendo console was my gameboy sp. I loved it when I was younger and played Kirby and the Amazing Mirror on it all the time. When I went to my grandmas to get it, everything was in a room as I and she left it. She helped me find it and gave me the charger cord. However, when I went to take it home. I couldnt help but feel sad about it. Like I had taken something that I shouldnt have taken. I walked out of the door feeling like I disturbed something that I enjoyed years and years ago. Has anyone else experienced the same thing?

I am not sure if this an issue of our version, but for us, they are printed at the end of the book with side number references. They are certainly funny in their absurdity, but I am not sure if they are really funny enough to go back through the book, follow references in annotations etc ... especially for a 10yo.

You also cannot really read them while reading the book, because they sometimes reference other FUTURE annotations, and you would have to regularly check if you missed one, because they are not indicated on the main pages.

Are they an essential part of the experience? I am thinking of Pratchett footnotes here, which really carry a lot of the humor. Countless of them are absolute gold, but even there I am not sure if I would go back through the book and read them at the end.
